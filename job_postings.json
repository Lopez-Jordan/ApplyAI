Most teams are already doing “something” to stay compliant, but it usually involves manual work, patchwork systems, and last-minute scrambles. That approach creates risk, slows down execution, and makes it hard to prove work was done correctly.\n\nProcess Street replaces those workarounds with a structured, scalable platform where documentation, workflows, and compliance monitoring all live in one place. Teams create, automate, and run repeatable workflows with no code, while Cora our AI Compliance Agent watches every task in real time. Cora flags skipped steps, enforces standards, and ensures processes follow your internal policies and external frameworks like ISO, SOX, and HIPAA.\n\nWith Process Street, you don’t just document procedures, you turn them into action. Policies are followed. Tasks are completed. Execution is tracked, and audits are always ready.\n\nUsed by Salesforce, Colliers, Drift, and over 3,000 organizations, Process Street gives operations and compliance leaders the control, clarity, and confidence they need to scale.",

Most teams are already doing “something” to stay compliant, but it usually involves manual work, patchwork systems, and last-minute scrambles. That approach creates risk, slows down execution, and makes it hard to prove work was done correctly.\n\nProcess Street replaces those workarounds with a structured, scalable platform where documentation, workflows, and compliance monitoring all live in one place. Teams create, automate, and run repeatable workflows with no code, while Cora our AI Compliance Agent watches every task in real time. Cora flags skipped steps, enforces standards, and ensures processes follow your internal policies and external frameworks like ISO, SOX, and HIPAA.\n\nWith Process Street, you don’t just document procedures, you turn them into action. Policies are followed. Tasks are completed. Execution is tracked, and audits are always ready.\n\nUsed by Salesforce, Colliers, Drift, and over 3,000 organizations, Process Street gives operations and compliance leaders the control, clarity, and confidence they need to scale.",

This is a rare opportunity for an experienced developer who wants to help peers make dramatic gains in their day-to-day jobs, and ultimately for their organizations.<br><br>\\ An ideal candidate would be someone who is already a Depot user and fan who wants to find a new role in a fast-growing, venture-backed startup. There is no template for this role, so it requires a self-starter to shape how we support and grow our customer base, working directly with engineering teams at fast-growing companies to solve their most critical build performance challenges.\\ \\ To support our rapidly growing customer base, we are looking for <strong>Solutions Engineers</strong> based in the US or Canada.\\ \\ Depot has created a build performance and developer productivity platform unlike any other. We've turned what it means to build software locally and in CI upside down by making performance a top-level feature rather than an afterthought. Our platform accelerates existing tools and services like Docker builds and GitHub Actions, saving Depot customers all over the world literal years in build time.<br><br>\\ This role's success will be driven by providing deeply technical guidance that helps customers extract maximum value from Depot while identifying opportunities for where we can further help.
